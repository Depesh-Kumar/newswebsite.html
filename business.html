              <b><p>India successfully launched its first privately developed rocket, the Vikram-S, on Friday, marking “a new era” for the country’s commercial space industry. The 545-kilogram rocket, developed by space start-up Skyroot Aerospace, took off from the Indian Space Research Organisation’s (ISRO’s) launch site in Sriharikota, near Chennai, at around 11.30 am and hit a peak altitude of 89.5 kilometres.

                Prime Minister Narendra Modi lauded the successful foray of a private player into the country’s space sector. “A historic moment for India…It is an important milestone in the journey of India’s private space industry,” he tweeted.
                
                India opened the space sector for private companies in 2020, allowing them to build rockets and satellites as part of the Prarambh mission.</b></p>
